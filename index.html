        <li>1 spring onion</li>
        <li>25g honey</li>
        <li>5g toasted sesame seeds</li>
        <li>125g seasonal radishes</li>
        <li>80g mangetout</li>
        <li>30ml mirin</li>
        <li>320g British skinless chicken thighs</li>
        <li>30ml red wine vinegar</li>
        <li>1 garlic clove</li>
        <li>15ml tamari soy sauce</li>
        <li>130g brown rice</li>
        <li>1 carrot</li> 
    </ul>

    <h2>Bereiding</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil a half a kettle<br>
            Rinse the brown rice, add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat<br>

            Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 15-20 min or until it's tender with a slight bite<br>

            Once cooked, drain and return it to the pot and keep covered until serving</li>
        <li>Whilst the rice is cooking, peel the ginger (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and chop into thin matchsticks

            Finely slice the radishes</li>
        <li>Combine 1 tbsp [2 tbsp] sugar with 100ml [200ml] boiled water in a heatproof bowl and stir until the sugar has dissolved<br>

            Add the red wine vinegar, ginger matchsticks and sliced radishes and set aside to pickle until serving – these are your pickled vegetables</li>
        <li>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick, with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium- high heat
            
            Once hot, add the chicken thighs and season them with a pinch of salt


            Cook for 3-4 min or until lightly browned on both sides

            Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic</li>
        <li>Once the chicken has browned, reduce the heat to medium and add the chopped garlic, tamari soy sauce, mirin, honey and 2 tbsp [4 tbsp] boiled water

            Cook, covered, for 8-10 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the sauce has thickened and sticky in consistency</li>
        <li>Whilst the sauce is thickening, top, tail, peel and grate the carrot[s]

            Trim, then slice the spring onion[s] finely
            
            Slice the mangetout in half lengthways
            
            Add the sliced mangetout to a large bowl, cover with boiled water and set aside to soften</li>
   
   
    </ol>
